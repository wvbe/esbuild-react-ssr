This is a Typescript based server-side rendering setup, using React, Emotion, hydration and as little extra software or
magic as possible.

The goal is a Bokito-proof solution that is easy to hack, upgrade and maintain.

#### Scripts

-   `npm run build` Builds the thing, really fast
-   `npm run watch` Watches for changes to Typescript files, and rebuilds the thing
-   `npm run deploy` Deploys whatever was built last to GitHub Pages.
